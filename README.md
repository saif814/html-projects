# HTML & CSS Practice Projects

This repository contains my personal practice projects using **HTML** and a bit of **CSS**. I'm uploading these to track my progress as I work on improving my front-end web development skills.

## 🚀 Purpose

- Practice HTML structure and semantic tags
- Learn and experiment with basic CSS styling
- Build a habit of using Git and GitHub for version control

## 📁 Project Structure

Each folder or file may contain:
- A standalone HTML page
- Optional CSS (either inline or in a separate `.css` file)

## 🛠️ Skills Practiced

- HTML elements and layout
- CSS properties and styling
- Git & GitHub workflows

## 📌 Note

These are **learning projects** — feel free to explore or suggest improvements!
